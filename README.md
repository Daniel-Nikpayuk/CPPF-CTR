Canadian Political Party Financials - Comparative Transparency Report
=====================================================================

An independent analysis of the comparative fiscal success of elected political parties within Canada, between 1981 and 2013.

## Introduction:

As the Canadian federal election looms near, it's time to take a closer look at the politics of it all.

The Conservative "Harper" government has been known for its smear campaigns, notably against Liberal leader
[Trudeau](http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/07/18/why-harper-attacks-trudeau-but-not-mulcair-hepburn.html),
but also against the NDP's
[Mulcair](http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/tories-release-first-attack-ad-against-ndp-leader-thomas-mulcair).
Political policy as well as *election claims and tactics* within in a stable and healthy government need to backed up with evidence
plain and simple.  The first line of such evidence is economic and fiscal data.

The inspiration of this analysis is somewhat a reaction to Harper's *anti-science*, *anti-evidence* ideology, with the intent
here to look at the recent history of fiscal **budget balances** and to compare how these parties have actually done in the past. 
The focus on economic record is also part of the reaction as Harper especially likes to proclaim his party is the only
responsible economic actor in government---which it is not.

It will be shown that in fact the **NDP** has the best record.

This analysis is an extension of the article:
["Fiscal Record of Canadian Political Parties"](http://www.progressive-economics.ca/2011/04/29/fiscal-record-of-canadian-political-parties/)
by economist Toby Sanger.

To be clear, it is not a direct *derivation* as I did not have access to his datasets or methods, but it does attempt to reproduce
his results. The necessary data sets have been reproduced and validated, with some slight variations on method---resulting in a small
change of the numbers, but not the resulting relationships.

## Motivation:

So here's the question: If such an analysis already exists, why read this one?

1. **Date**: It's been updated for the most recently available fiscal years. His article is four years old,
	with data going only up to 2010.
2. **Transparency**: I am posting my datasets as well as my methods here for anyone to critically deconstruct and debug.
3. **Bonus**: I include a few results his analysis did not.

### Full disclosure:

Aaron Paquette, the NDP Candidate for Edmonton Manning in the upcoming 2015 Federal election requested this project.
Out of respect for him and his leadership, I have volunteered.

With that said, although my bias is in support of the NDP this election---and I certainly support Aaron's
individual leadership regardless---I am a complexity theorist at heart. I don't support a single recursive political
ideology as universal (within a complex system), rather I support the evidence; and I support evidence based politics.

For me, the bottom line is the NDP has a good track record, as the below analysis will demonstrate.

# The Analysis:

My analysis confirms Toby Sanger's: that the NDP with their time in office have proven to be the most responsible economic
managers out of the three.

So NDP have about 72 years of provincial experience, and about 31 of those years they ran surpluses.
Conservatives on the other hand have about 148 years of experience, and
