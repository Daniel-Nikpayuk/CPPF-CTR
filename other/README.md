Author's Note
=============

Respectfully, if you find my work at all adequate, I would like to point out I am an Indigenous person in Canada.
In particular I am Inuit.

You might be turned off by me bring this up, saying it's unprofessional, but I bring it up as part of the ongoing
dialogue towards improving this society called Canada. I put in the effort for this report, and if you found any
use of it, I feel I deserve a few personal words.

I first and foremost bring  up my Indigeneity as a matter of pride. If you yourself are Indigenous reading this,
please know that us Indigenous peoples are quite capable of professional level analyses such as these, even if
the rest of the world tells us we're not or that we have to do things their way first. It's not true. I have a
Bachelor of Arts majoring in mathematics minoring in economics, and that level of education does help, but it's
not as if I have a Masters or PhD. I'm willing to claim this analysis is professional level because I've both
reproduced what a professional economist has done, as well as reproducing the same fiscal results as that of
a bank (RBC).

Secondly, if you're not Indigenous, but are in a position to hire or help, just know we Indigenous peoples are
quite capable, but we need to be given the chance. We'll make as many opportunities for ourselves as we can
moving forward, but we need allies and accomplices as well. I myself at the time of writing this work two
part-time jobs as a cashier and cook respectively. My skill set is being completely under-used, and this aging
body knows it. I'm not just saying this for me though, I'm saying this for all those capable Indigenous folk
who have been passed up because someone didn't want to take a chance on them.

If you're in human resources, please consider the sociology of it all: You hire those who you think will
"fit in"; the most reliable predictor of finding someone who fits in is to find friends of existing employees.
If an existing employee fits in, it's likely people they're willing to vouch for will also fit it. The sociology
comes in when you realize in a largely white society, most white people's personal social networks consist
mostly of white people. As an unintended consequence, regarding diversity, things end being kept in-house.

Education, diversity, and risk are very intimately connected. If you're not educated to existing diversity,
you can't conclude it is anything but a risk, because you lack certainty about it. You'll find though,
that if you make the effort to learn about other ways, they become far less risky, and you have the added
rewards that come with diverse creativity and problem solving. It doesn't start with them, it starts with you.

Just some things to think about. Thank you.
